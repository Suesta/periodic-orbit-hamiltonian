# Periodic Orbit Computation in Hamiltonian Systems

Development of numerical methods in C for the computation of periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems.

## üöÄ Description

This project implements advanced numerical routines to detect and refine periodic orbits in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. It was developed by V√≠ctor Suesta at the age of 23 as part of an advanced scientific computing study. The core functionalities include:

- **Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 7-8 integration (RKF78)** for high-precision trajectory propagation.
- **Variational equation flow integration**, used for stability analysis and Newton refinement.
- **QR decomposition routine**, essential for handling the monodromy matrix and the stability multipliers.
- **Newton‚Äôs method for multiple variables**, applied to locate and refine periodic orbits using shooting techniques.

All implementations are written in pure C, without external libraries, and optimized for clarity and scientific reproducibility.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.c`: Entry point and main simulation logic.
- `Pr*.c`: Different examples and parameter configurations.
- `FUNCTIONS.c`: Core numerical integration and Newton method functions.
- `FuncionsQR.h`: Custom header for the QR decomposition.
- `Instruccions per executar.txt`: Execution instructions (in Catalan).

## üß™ How to Run

1. Compile the desired source file using `gcc`. Example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o orbit Pr4Ex2.c FUNCTIONS.c -lm
